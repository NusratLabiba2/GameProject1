Sore wo Ai to Yobu dake


Myra lyrics for events:

Nee, asa me sameru to ne 
Yoko ni kimi ga ite miru nagai matsuge goshi
tsunagu te to te
Mou, atarimae dayone
dakedo sonna hibi nakusanai youni
dakiyoseru soba ni

Kimi no katachizukuru mono wa subete aishitai to omottanda
Kimi ni me ni utsuru sekai no tsuzuki wo mitai to omottanda

pc runs after npc myra through the events of the game using the up arrow key to jump

"r" for reset

Sore wo Ai to yobu dake:

pc runs with npc through the game and the obstacles using up arrow keys until 3/4ths through the game.

in the last quarter of the game: the up arrow key is used to jump and the right and left are to go forward or back.
if no keys are pressed, the pc does not move.
the ground vanishes and pc must jump from step to step
npc goes ahead

at the end of the game pc is at the top of the tower
